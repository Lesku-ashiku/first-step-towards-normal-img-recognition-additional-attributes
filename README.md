MOST OF THIS PROJECT ITS NOT MY WORK
i only implemented code that already existed to the car recognition 

BUT I DID DO SOMETHING

in the original code there was basicaly a color name for EVERY rgb combination so i tried to stacking to a few colors
using the rgb variables and making some "requirements"/"limits" to be a color
the results are very approximated or just wrong
but the promblem is probably just the comparison of the values to the requirements to a certain color
this was a school project so i didnt really care to stay hours sitting at my desk just to find the best,"limits"??
this project is also a few moths old
it could also be the fact that the program might be taking piece of the road instead of the car.

i remember making this in a day and nothing else
